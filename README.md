# SpotiFour
Spotify client for MTU Team Software Project Fall 2017. It will include basic features from Spotify\
(such as a music player, playlists, etc.) and a display lyrics feature.\

This project uses node.js, so you will need to download and install it before you can run this code.\
Download from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once node.js is installed, open the node.js terminal and go to the project directory. Enter the \
command 'npm install'. This will install the node modules. Then, go to the authorization_code directory\
in the node.js terminal and enter the command 'node app.js'. The message 'Listening on 8888' should appear.\

Then, go to your browser an type 'localhost:8888' in the address bar. This will bring you to the application\
login screen. We have created a Spotify account specifically for this project:\
