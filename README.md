# Lyricon
Spotify client for MTU Team Software Project Fall 2017. It includes basic features from Spotify\
(such as a music player, playlists, etc.), as well as a display lyrics feature.

This project uses node.js, so you will need to download and install it before you can run this code.\
Download from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once node.js is installed, open the node.js command prompt (NOTE this is different from the node.js application) and navigate  to the project directory using 'cd'. Run the
command 'npm install'. This will install the node modules. Then, go to the 'authorization_code' directory within the SpotiFour directory
in the node.js command prompt and enter the command 'node app.js'. The message 'Listening on 8888' should appear. If you have node.js integration enabled in your IDE, you can run app.js
directly from your IDE once you have run 'npm install'.

Then, go to your browser an type 'localhost:8888' in the address bar. This will bring you to the application\
login screen. We have created a Spotify account specifically for this project (Login information is located in the deliverables).
